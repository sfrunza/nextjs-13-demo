              <h3>Packing Specialty Items</h3>
              <p>
                Packing specialty items requires careful attention to detail and
                skill to ensure safe delivery. Specialty items may require
                custom boxes, specialty wrapping and cushioning materials, as
                well as specialized labeling. Our movers secure and label all
                materials to ensure items are not damaged during transit. We
                take additional care to ensure that any fragile items are
                properly protected and padded. We also use specialized equipment
                for heavier items if necessary. Following all packing
                instructions and taking the extra time to properly package
                specialty items can help ensure safe and successful delivery.
              </p>
